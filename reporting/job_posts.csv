CoinSwitch breaks down the complexities in Crypto, empowering the everyday Indian to make informed investment decisions on a simple and trusted platform. When we started up, Crypto was a field reserved for specialists. Today, over 18 million users trust CoinSwitch to learn, purchase and invest in Crypto. That makes us India’s largest crypto app.

On CoinSwitch, users can invest in Crypto with a few simple taps, either as a one-time purchase or in regular intervals through an SIP. But simplicity is not a substitute for informed decisions. A CoinSwitch user spends 27 minutes on our app—to learn about Crypto and Web3 through our educational content and understand the market sentiments through CRE8, the Crypto Rupee Index.

But we are just getting started. CoinSwitch not only plans to double down on making Crypto accessible to everyone but is on track to become the one-stop wealth-tech destination for every Indian.

CoinSwitch breaks down the complexities in Crypto, empowering the everyday Indian to make informed investment decisions on a simple and trusted platform. When we started up, Crypto was a field reserved for specialists. Today, over 18 million users trust CoinSwitch to learn, purchase and invest in Crypto. That makes us India’s largest crypto app.

On CoinSwitch, users can invest in Crypto with a few simple taps, either as a one-time purchase or in regular intervals through an SIP. But simplicity is not a substitute for informed decisions. A CoinSwitch user spends 27 minutes on our app—to learn about Crypto and Web3 through our educational content and understand the market sentiments through CRE8, the Crypto Rupee Index.

But we are just getting started. CoinSwitch not only plans to double down on making Crypto accessible to everyone but is on track to become the one-stop wealth-tech destination for every Indian.
